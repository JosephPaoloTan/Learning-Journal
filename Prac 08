**Learning Insights**
I can say that having a workflow for Content Management Systems is important as it helps to maximise efficiency, consistency, management, development and distribution of content. This means that we are able to ensure
quality and efficiency when carrying out our tasks because the workflow guides us and does not waste time. This can be done by creating a dedicated communication channel (in our case slack), collaborative channel (github)
and also assign the tasks optimally. 

The test proves that without the workflow we are very disoriented and confused on how to proceed, whereas with the workflow we are able to use our time more efficiently and focus on the quality of the work being done.
