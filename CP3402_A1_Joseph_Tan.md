Learning Journal for Assignment 1 CP3402

**Learning Activities**
For this assignment I was tasked to create 2 websites using 2 different Content Management Systems, namely Joomla and WordPress. I was also required to create 
these websites in such a way that they are similar / identical. 
After doing so, I was tasked to compare and state the differences between the two Content Management Systems and decide on which one is better.

**Estimated Hours**
7 hours

**Content Insights**
After using both Content Management Systems to create websites, I have come to a few conclusions and insights based on my experiences with these two CMS'. Firstly, it is very noticeable that Joomla and Wordpress
have very different approaches and functionalities. For Joomla, I would compare it in a similar way to Java, where it is capable of more intricate websites with steeper learning curves for users. It is more flexible
and allows more intricate site structures and permissions. 
When I was using Wordpress, I had the same feeling as python. It was very user-friendly and very easy to use. It also has an extensive plugin ecosystem. It is very simple and easy to learn, and has many customization options
available through themes and plugins. 
To conclude, for a beginner like me I would certainly prefer Wordpress due to its user-friendly interface, ease of use and vast customization opportunities. However, for more experienced developers, they may choose
to prefer Joomla as it provides higher flexibility and intricate site structures and permissions. 

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
Personally, as I do not really want to go into complex website construction and/or content management systems, I would probably focus on developing further my skills with Wordpress. This is because I feel like it would
still be able to benefit me when I am employed in any type of content creation or digital marketing fields which require some level of content management and/or designing. It would make my life easier as it helps to
create good medium-sized websites that I can create for blogs or smaller companies, and is easy to learn and is overall a better choice for my career path that I would like to pursue. However, this does not mean that 
I would not polish my skills with Joomla in the future, as I do not truly know what opportunities lie for me. Also, having adequate skills in both may boost my chances of getting a good opportunity in the workforce.
